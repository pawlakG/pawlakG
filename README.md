# Dr. Geoffrey Pawlak | PharmD, PhD
### Oncology Bioinformatics Researcher

I focus on identifying actionable biological levers in oncology by leveraging **DNA-seq** and **RNA-seq** data at **bulk** or **single-cell** level. My approach prioritizes high-performance, interoperable, and reproducible computational frameworks to bridge the gap between dry-lab findings and clinical applications.

## Research Focus & Vision
* **Current Research:** Decoding complex oncogenic mechanisms through multi-omics integration and robust statistical modeling of bulk sequencing data.
* **Strategic Direction:** Transitioning towards **Single-Cell Technology Integration** to resolve intratumoral heterogeneity and refine precision oncology strategies.

Objective: Developing a unified network influence map to navigate GBM heterogeneity and plasticity.

Methodology: Used representation learning and the h-LICORN algorithm to infer a highly specific coregulatory network (GBM-CoRegNet) from 1,612 tumors.

Key Findings: Refined GBM classification into seven molecular classes , identifying the CL-C "cilium-rich" subclass as an intermediate state linked to chemotherapy resistance.

Regulators: Identified PAX8 and NKX2.5 as master regulators; NKX2.5 negatively impacts survival by regulating glucose metabolism.

#### **[Therapeutic repurposing pipeline]**

his project implements a virtual screening and machine learning workflow to identify high-affinity, low-toxicity inhibitors targeting the MET receptor.

Architecture: Integration of ChEMBL and PubChem databases with structural filtering based on Lipinski’s rules and undesirable motif exclusion.

Methodology: Deep Learning approach using a Neural Network (pIC50​ prediction MAE: 0.68) and the eToxPred algorithm to prioritize potent candidates with favorable safety profiles.

Pragmatic Approach: Focuses on narrowing massive chemical libraries down to a validated subset of 1,344 compounds to minimize experimental timeframe and budget.
